  abstract = {BACKGROUND The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project's forecasts up to 2100 suggest fertility drops will be even greater in sub-Saharan Africa than the UN Population Division (UNPD) has predicted. OBJECTIVE This reflection summarizes the main assumptions used in the GBD fertility forecasts. I assess the methods used, focusing on high fertility countries and the use of met need for contraceptives as a predictor. RESULTSBased on GBD's forecasting method, I draw two conclusions. Firstly, GBD fertility forecasts are based on unvalidated assumptions about increasing met need for contraception and may overestimate decreases in fertility in countries with low levels of modern contraceptive use.  Secondly, the GBD forecast model for fertility is not a causal model for predicting changes. Claims GBD researchers make about the effect of changing access to family planning on fertility are not informative for guiding policy. Based on the GBD validation exercise, I conclude that the GBD study did not check the performance of the method for predicting left-out fertility data. Also the approach used to compare the predictive performance of UNPD and GBD forecasting methods may give the GBD method an inherent advantage.CONCLUSIONSCommunication regarding the GBD method and its findings must avoid causal language and acknowledge the method's limitations. Future research should examine the performance of the method, especially for countries with low modern contraceptive use.CONTRIBUTIONThis paper summarizes the GBD fertility forecasting method and indicates three areas of concern about it and its use.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We describe a Bayesian projection model to produce country-specific projections of the total fertility rate (TFR) for all countries. The model decomposes the evolution of TFR into three phases: pre-transition high fertility, the fertility transition, and post-transition low fertility. The model for the fertility decline builds on the United Nations Population Division's current deterministic projection methodology, which assumes that fertility will eventually fall below replacement level. It models the decline in TFR as the sum of two logistic functions that depend on the current TFR level, and a random term. A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to project future TFR based on both the country's TFR history and the pattern of all countries. It is estimated from United Nations estimates of past TFR in all countries using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The post-transition low fertility phase is modeled using an autoregressive model, in which long-term TFR projections converge toward and oscillate around replacement level. The method is evaluated using out-of-sample projections for the period since 1980 and the period since 1995, and is found to be well calibrated.},

These projections, based on a vast amount of data, complex estimates and models, have gained high visibility, also in subsequent media coverage and interviews. Yet, IHME highly publicised population data and scenarios suffer from numerous issues with the underlying data, models and scenarios as well as over-simplistic interpretations of their results. This study aims to substantiate our concerns, spelled out earlier in a letter to the Lancet (Basten, Sobotka et al. 2020), and review major issues and weaknesses with IHME projections and their interpretation. First, we critically examine the data issues, models and their underlying assumptions, including implausible uncertainty intervals and contrasts in predicted trends among countries from broader regions, which often share similar economic and cultural characteristics. Second, we discuss the interpretations of the main findings presented in the discussion part of the paper by Vollset et al. and reflect on the media representation of the projection results. In conclusion, we highlight internal inconsistencies in the IHME modelling approach, which lead to questionable projections for many countries and scenarios.},

Future fertility patterns are a key input to estimation of future population size, but they are surrounded by substantial uncertainty and diverging methodologies of estimation and forecasting, leading to important differences in global population projections. Changing population size and age structure might have profound economic, social, and geopolitical impacts in many countries. In this study, we developed novel methods for forecasting mortality, fertility, migration, and population. We also assessed potential economic and geopolitical effects of future demographic shifts.},
