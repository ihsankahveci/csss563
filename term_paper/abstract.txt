The article _Fully Bayesian Benchmarking of Small Area Estimation Models_ (2020, Zhang, J.L. and Bryant, J.) presents a new approach to small domain estimation, using larger area estimates and Bayesian hierarchical models to provide small area estimate posterior distributions congruent with neighboring small areas and the larger region encompassing them. This report begins with a summary of the article, followed by an analysis of the methods presented in the article and their recreation for this report. Then these methods are evaluated by (1) recreating the real-world application to estimating mortality rates for local authority districts in England and Wales presented by the authors, and (2) applying the same analysis to mortality rates in Philippine provinces. This report concludes with a discussion of these evaluations.
