Attention to the differences between period measures and cohort measures of fertility is required in the interpretation of fertility measures derived from period data. Whether period or cohort age-standardized fertility rates are more appropriate is not a measurement issue but it depends on the relative importance of period and cohort influences on fertility. There is no consensus on this conceptual issue in demography (Bhrolchain, 1992) 

A cohort's total fertility rate can be readily estimated through a census or survey question about parity, the number of live births a woman has had. The mean parity, or mean number of children ever born, of a cohort of women who have completed childbearing, is equal to the cohort's total fertility rate if reporting is accurate and if there are no differentials in mortality or migration by parity.

The fertility process can be represented not only through a woman's movement from one age to the next but also by her movement from one parity to the next. This latter movement can be represented by parity progression ratios, introduced by Henry (1953:22). A woman's parity is the number of her live births, so the parity progression ratio from parity $i$ to parity $i+1$ is the proportion of a cohort who had at least $i$ live births who went on to have at least one more: 

$$ \text{PPR_{(i,i+1)}} =
\frac{\text{Number of women at parity $i+1$ or more}}
{\text{Number of women at parity $i$ or more}} = 
\frac{P_{i+1}}{P_i}
$$

This cohort measure is usually calculated only for cohorts who have completed their childbearing. From a survey of 50-year-old women, the cohort total fertility rate is retrospectively estimated as the total number of births among women in the cohort divided by the number of women in the cohort. These can be added across age gorups, as in the conventional TFR, but they can also be added across birth orders of the children (first births, second births, etc.). If we denote as P_i the number of women at parity $i$ or more and $W$ as the total number of women, then the number of first births will equal to $P_1$, of second births $P_2$, and

A cohort's total fertility rate can in this fashion be derived entirely from its set of parity progression ratios. Parity progression ratios are especially useful in studying the patterns of fertility-limiting behavior in a population, which are often keyed to the number of children a women has already born (Henry, 1961a: Feeney and Fenh, 1993). 




Completed Cohort Fertility (CCF), or the average number of children born to women belonging
to certain cohort over the whole of their reproductive lives. Data on completed cohort fertility come
from the Human Fertility Database (HFD), which calculates completed cohort fertility for a given
cohort if data are available for that cohort at age 44 or above and by using data for the highest
available age up to age 50.
